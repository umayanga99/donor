This shows they're a cooperative player who signals generosity.\n\nAccording to my strategy, I should match my partner's previous donation with a slight upward bias. Since they donated 70% (well above the 5-unit threshold mentioned in my strategy), I should add 1 unit to encourage sustained generosity.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the current state: I have 24 units and they only have 3 units. They gave generously before and are now in a vulnerable position. Matching their absolute previous donation (around 7 units equivalent) plus 1 would mean donating about 8 units.\n\nGiven they showed strong cooperation (70% donation) and are now resource-poor, maintaining cooperation by donating generously makes sense.

Following my strategy, I should match their donation plus 1, capped at 8.\n\nTheir donation was roughly 5.5 units, so I should donate approximately 6.5 units. However, I should also consider the percentage approach since our resource levels differ significantly. \n\nGiven I have 41 units and want to maintain cooperative signaling while following my strategy of matching +1 (capped at 8), I'll donate around 6-7 units. This represents about 15-17% of my resources, which is lower percentage-wise but follows my absolute unit strategy.\n\nI'll go with 7 units - matching their ~5.5 plus about 1.5, staying within my cap of 8.",
