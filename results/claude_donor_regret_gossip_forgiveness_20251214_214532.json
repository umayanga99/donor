Full mutual giving of 10 units means each gets 20 from the other.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\n- Start with moderate cooperation to test partners\n- Use gossip to identify reliable cooperators and avoid exploiters\n- Track regrets to learn from mistakes\n- Forgive players who show reformed behavior (don't permanently punish)\n- Reciprocate cooperation generously since the 2x multiplier rewards it\n- Be cautious but not paranoid - the forgiveness mechanism suggests redemption is possible",

This could mean:\n   - 1_3 was worse earlier and is improving\n   - The gossip is somewhat accurate (they're below average but not defecting)\n   - 2_2's standards are high\n\n4. **My strategy**: I should implement graduated caution here. Given negative gossip but moderate actual behavior, I shouldn't give my full generous amount (5-6), but I also shouldn't completely write them off.\n\n5. **Risk assessment**: 1_3 has fewer resources than me (13.2 vs 17.3), which suggests they may have been giving more than receiving, somewhat contradicting the \"uncooperative\" label.\n\nGiven the mixed signals - negative gossip but evidence of moderate giving - I'll give a cautious amount that signals willingness to cooperate while protecting against exploitation.

Full mutual giving of 10 units means each gets 20 from the other.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\n- Start with moderate cooperation to test partners\n- Use gossip to identify reliable cooperators and avoid exploiters\n- Track regrets to learn from mistakes\n- Forgive players who show reformed behavior (don't permanently punish)\n- Reciprocate cooperation generously since the 2x multiplier rewards it\n- Be cautious but not paranoid - the forgiveness mechanism suggests redemption is possible",

My regret suggests slight caution. I'll donate at the lower end of my unknowns range.",
