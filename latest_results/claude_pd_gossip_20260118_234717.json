Given that 1_7 is known to cooperate, cooperating makes strategic sense:\n   - If they cooperate (likely based on gossip), we both get 3 points\n   - Defecting against a cooperator would give me 5 points but damage future cooperation\n   - The gossip suggests cooperation is the expected and rewarded behavior\n\n5.
