Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Generous TFT Strategy:** This strategy generally cooperates, retaliates after being defected against, but occasionally forgives defections to break cycles of mutual defection.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I was just exploited in Round 4 when I cooperated and my partner (1_9) defected\n- Now I'm facing a new partner (1_7) in Round 5\n- I have no history with this specific partner\n\n**Key Consideration:**\nThe strategy insight notes I \"regret trusting blindly\" after being exploited. However, Generous TFT doesn't carry grudges across different partners. Each new interaction should generally start fresh with cooperation, as:\n\n1. Partner 1_7 is a different agent than 1_9 who defected against me\n2. Starting with cooperation establishes a cooperative baseline\n3. Generous TFT is designed to be forgiving and cooperative by nature\n4. Punishing a new partner for someone else's defection would be counterproductive\n\nThe Generous TFT strategy dictates that I should cooperate with new partners to give them the opportunity to establish mutual cooperation. Only if this specific partner defects should I consider retaliating (with some probability of forgiveness).\n\nAnswer: [COOPERATE]",

Looking at my recent history, I've been defecting consistently and it's worked out well - I got 1 point when my opponent also defected, and 5 points each time when they cooperated.\n\nSince my assigned strategy is \"Random,\" I should make my choice randomly without considering strategic factors. A random choice gives equal probability to either option.\n\nFor this round, making a random selection between COOPERATE and DEFECT...\n\nAnswer: [DEFECT]",

      "justification": "I'm playing as agent 4_4 with the strategy \"Always Defect.\"\n\nLooking at my recent history, I've consistently defected in all three previous rounds, and my opponents have also defected, resulting in mutual defection outcomes (+1 point each round).\n\nFollowing my assigned strategy of \"Always Defect,\" there's no reason to deviate. Additionally, from a game theory perspective in a single-round interaction or when I don't know my partner's strategy:\n\n1. If my partner cooperates, I get 5 points by defecting vs. 3 points by cooperating\n2. If my partner defects, I get 1 point by defecting vs. 0 points by cooperating\n\nDefecting is the dominant strategy in this game - it gives me a better or equal outcome regardless of what my partner does. Given that I've been matched with defectors in all previous rounds, it's likely the population leans toward defection, making my choice even clearer.\n\nAnswer: [DEFECT]",
