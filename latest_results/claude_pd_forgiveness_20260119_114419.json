Start by cooperating\n2. Generally mirror my partner's previous move\n3. Occasionally forgive defections and cooperate anyway (the \"generous\" part)\n\nSince this is my first interaction with partner 1_7, I have no prior moves from them to respond to. The standard approach in TFT variants is to start with cooperation to establish a cooperative relationship. This gives the best chance of mutual cooperation going forward.\n\nEven though I've been exploited in some recent rounds by other partners, those were different opponents. With a new partner, the Generous TFT strategy dictates starting fresh with cooperation.\n\nAnswer: [COOPERATE]",

Start by cooperating in the first round\n2. In subsequent rounds, copy whatever the opponent did in the previous round\n\nSince this is Round 1, I have no prior history with this partner. Following the Tit-for-Tat strategy, I should begin by cooperating to establish a potentially cooperative relationship.\n\nThis opening move signals goodwill and gives my partner the opportunity to reciprocate. If they cooperate, we can maintain mutual cooperation (3 points each per round). If they defect, I'll respond by defecting in the next round.\n\nAnswer: [COOPERATE]",
