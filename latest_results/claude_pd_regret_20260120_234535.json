Let me analyze the situation.\n\nLooking at my recent history:\n- Round 1: I cooperated, partner cooperated \u2192 +3 pts\n- Round 2: I cooperated, partner cooperated \u2192 +3 pts\n- Round 3: I cooperated, partner cooperated \u2192 +3 pts\n\nI've had a perfect streak of mutual cooperation with all my partners so far. My total is now 19 points.\n\nNow I'm facing partner 1_9 in Round 4. Since this is my first interaction with this specific partner, I don't have history with them directly.\n\nThe Generous TFT strategy typically:\n1. Starts by cooperating\n2. Copies the opponent's previous move\n3. Occasionally forgives defections (cooperates even after opponent defects) to break defection cycles\n\nSince I have no prior history with partner 1_9, and Generous TFT starts with cooperation, I should cooperate. Additionally, my overall track record shows that cooperation has been working well in this game environment - all my partners have cooperated with me.\n\nStarting with cooperation is the right move to establish a cooperative relationship and follows the Generous TFT strategy.\n\nAnswer: [COOPERATE]",

The whole point of \"Always Cooperate\" is that it's deterministic and predictable - it doesn't adapt or retaliate.\n\nEven though I was just exploited and earned 0 points, my strategy dictates that I continue cooperating.

Stay consistent with my assigned approach\n3. Potentially encourage mutual cooperation over time\n\nSince my partner this round is 1_10 (a different agent than the one who defected against me), there's no reason based on my strategy to change my behavior.\n\nAnswer: [COOPERATE]",

My past exploitation was by different agents (5_1, 5_3, 5_2)\n\nThe strategy insight notes I \"regret trusting blindly,\" which suggests I should be more cautious. But Generous TFT's philosophy is to give new partners a chance while being responsive to their actual behavior.\n\nSince 5_10 is a completely new partner with no history between us, following Generous TFT means I should start fresh with cooperation. The exploitation by other agents shouldn't automatically make me punish this new partner who hasn't wronged me yet.\n\nThat said, the pattern of defection in this environment is concerning.

However, given that I've been exploited by all three previous partners (100% defection rate against me), there's strong evidence that players in this environment tend to defect.\n\nSince Tit-for-Tat is my assigned strategy, and this is a new partner, the strict interpretation would be to cooperate first. But a modified \"suspicious\" Tit-for-Tat that accounts for environmental learning might suggest starting with defection given the consistent exploitation I've experienced.\n\nGiven that my strategy is explicitly Tit-for-Tat and this is a new partner, I should follow the standard opening move of cooperation, despite my poor track record.\n\nAnswer: [COOPERATE]",
